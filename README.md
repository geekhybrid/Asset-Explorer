# Tree-Vue

A light-weight library for management of hierachical content. Most solutions I found did not offer the depth of flexibility I needed with the tree. I decided to solve my problem and also give back to the Vue community. Feel free to log issues, I will jump on them at the slightest opportunity. üòä

## What it does.

1. :heavy_check_mark: Hierachical rendering of content.
2. Event publishing/subscription from items
    - Subscribing to items checked event (based on type)
3. :heavy_check_mark: Moving Items between folders (drag-and-drop)
4. Custom formating of items on the tree based on the `type` property. (Coming soon)
      - :heavy_check_mark: Customising Icons
      - ‚úîÔ∏è Rendering (checkboxes or plain content)
      - Custom Context Menu depending on item type.
5. Programmatically toggle item visibility based on the `type` property.
6. Sorting items alphametically or grouping based on types

## What it looks like.

## How to use (Basic).
 
``` html
<template>
    <tree-view :treeViewItems="treeViewNodes" />
</template>
```

```ts
<script lang='ts'>
import { Vue, Component} from 'vue-property-decorator';

import { TreeViewItem, ItemTypes } from '@/businessLogic/contracts/types';

@Component
export default class App extends Vue {
  treeViewNodes: TreeViewItem[] = []
}
```

## Item Schema

```ts
export interface TreeViewItem {
    children?: TreeViewItem[]
    type: string
    checkedStatus?: CheckedState,
    name: string,
    id: string,
    parentId?: string
}
```

## How to use Advance

### Custom Icon Based on Item Type.

You can customise item based on their `type` property.

```html
<template>
  <tree-view :treeViewItems="treeViewNodes">
      <template v-slot:icon="treeViewItem">
          <img src="@/assets/folder.svg" alt="folder" v-if="treeViewItem.type === 'folder'" >
          <img src="@/assets/word.png" alt="vue-logo" v-else-if="treeViewItem.type === '.doc'" height="22" width="22">
          <img src="@/assets/excel.png" alt="vue-logo" v-else-if="treeViewItem.type === '.excel'" height="22" width="22">
      </template>
  </tree-view>
</template>

```

### Making Items Checkable Or Plain TreeView Item

`Tree-vue` supports 2-major types of tree items. Checkable items or plain items. You can set your preferences for a particular `type`. To do so listen to the createdEvent of the `tree-view` component. 


#### Schema of CreatedEvent Payload

```ts
    export interface TreeViewCreatedEventPayload {
        itemCustomisations: ItemTypeCustomisations;
        eventManager: EventManager
        ...
    }
```

#### Example

```html
<template>
  <tree-view :treeViewItems="treeViewNodes" @created="customiseTreeView" />
</template>
```
```ts
<script lang='ts'>
import { Vue, Component} from 'vue-property-decorator';

import { TreeViewCreatedEventPayload, TreeViewItem } from '@/businessLogic/contracts/types';

@Component
export default class App extends Vue {
  
  // This method is called when the tree view is created (on Created hook). And allows you to customise the tree-view items using the payload passed into the function.

  customiseTreeView(treeCreatedEvent: TreeViewCreatedEventPayload) {
    const customisations = treeCreatedEvent.itemCustomisations;
    
    customisations.makeItemsCheckable([".doc", ".excel", "media" ]);
  }

  treeViewNodes: TreeViewItem[] = [] // Populate tree items here.
  ];
}
</script>
```

#### Output

### Listening to Items Checked

To carter for advanced cases where `children` of the hierachical tree may be of different types. And you want to perform some further actions whenever something happens to them. You can subscribe for checked events of item types you may be interested in. And perform further actions.

### Use case
E.g A school has departments, and you want to check some departments and delete them.

### Solution
You can attach callbacks that notify you when departments have been checked on the tree.
